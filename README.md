## The Assignment

Please create an app that can display a list of items, price, and discount, and let users add products to a basket and see the total price with discounts applied.

The app should:

- Load the list of products from an API
- Display the list of products in a page which uses a JavaScript based UI library
- Let the user add products to a basket
- Calculate the total cost of the basket, including discounts â€“ the price calculation should be done server-side 
- Have a facility for users to remove items from the basket / update quantity
 
Optional: 

- Have some Material-UI v4 components 
- The site should have a consistent and cohesive brand

The API can use whatever technology you choose, but node.js is preferred.
You can hard code the products into the API or use a json file, whichever you prefer.

## Installation Instructions

To install the full functionality version:

```
1. Download the zip file from the `version-with-discounts` branch [here](https://github.com/alexbfree/react-product-catalog-demo/archive/refs/heads/version-with-discounts.zip)
2. Unzip the zipfile
3. Open the `index.html` file in the root directory in your web browser. This uses bundled Webpack files in the `dist` directory to load the site; since all code is client-side no running server is required.
```

# Checking out and inspecting the code

This repository contains the code I have written for this coding task. There are two branches, with code at different levels, both are fully functional and can be code-inspected:

- [`main` branch] : This version includes all the functionality except the discounts functionality, and is the preferred version for you to inspect the code.
- [`version-with-discounts` branch]: This version is a more advanced version which includes the discounts functionality, but remains unmerged because in my view it overcomplicates the code, and in a real scenario I would refactor and redesign this functionality before merging into main/production code, which time did not allow in this case.

## To inspect and use the simple version (preferred for code reading):

```
git clone https://github.com/alexbfree/react-product-catalog-demo.git
cd react-product-catalog-demo
git checkout main
git pull
npm install
npm start
```
Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

## To inspect and use the advanced version (preferred for maximal feature set):

```
git clone https://github.com/alexbfree/react-product-catalog-demo.git
cd react-product-catalog-demo
git checkout version-with-discounts
git pull
npm install
npm start
```
Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
